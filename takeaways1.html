<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

Homebrew databases bring complexities and deficiencies. In order to optimally utilise the possibilities of information management systems of volunteer coordinators, two trajectories for research have been suggested; more human-centered databases and migration standards. With an eye to the future in which big data will take a more important role - even in volunteering organisations â€“ suggest that development towards migration standard would be more suitable for volunteering organisations. Although more technical expertise is needed, the roles of the people in these organisations evolve simultaneously. Nowadays people are more digital native and have more easy access to technical knowledge through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Therefore, funding will not be a fundamental impediment.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

Schema.org is fast becoming a key instrument in the web application branch. Evidence suggests that schema.org is among the most important factors for data structuring on the web (GUHA, R.V, et al. 2016). History has shown how difficult it was to find relevant data through an information platform on the web (GUHA, R.V, et al. 2016). This paper compares the different between the past and the recent demand of schema.org since the increased interest in big data. Nevertheless, schema.org shows also several development the past few years giving more opportunities and makes it more popular in usage (GUHA, R.V, et al. 2016). This gives me more the impression that since the increased interest in big data, schema.org re-developed itself and keeps up with the time (GUHA, R.V, et al. 2016). The supporting teams such as google and Microsoft helping schema.org played a necessary role within its development (GUHA, R.V, et al. 2016).
